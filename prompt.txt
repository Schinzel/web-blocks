Now I have all the pieces. Please analyze the actual path generation logic:

1. **WebBlockPageRouteDescriptor**: Look at lines 39-41. It gets relativePath, removes "pages/" prefix, and returns special case "/" for "landing", otherwise returns the path as-is. NO class name is included.

2. **WebBlockApiRouteDescriptor**: Look at lines 37-41. It gets relativePath, gets classNameKebabCase, and returns "$relativePath/$classNameKebabCase". Class name IS included.

3. **WebBlockPageApiRouteDescriptor**: Look at lines 37-42. It gets relativePath, removes "pages/" prefix, gets classNameKebabCase, and returns "page-api/$pagePathWithoutPages/$classNameKebabCase". Class name IS included.

4. **RouteUtil.getRelativePath**: Look at lines 50-59. It takes the class package, removes the webRootPackage prefix, and converts to path format.

Based on this analysis, the DOCUMENTATION is CORRECT and my TESTS are WRONG for Page Routes. Page routes should NOT include class names in the path, only directory structure. 

Please confirm this analysis and identify what needs to be corrected in my tests.
